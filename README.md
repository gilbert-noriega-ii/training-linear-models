# Goals

- The goal of this repo is to understand Linear Regression/Polynomial Regression models and walkthrough two different ways to test it.
- Use a "closed-form" equation that directly computes the model parameters that best fit the model to the training set.
- Use an iterative optimization approach called Gradient Descent that generally tweaks the model parameters to minimize the cost functioin over the training set, eventually converging to the same set of parameters as the first method. 
- Use learning curves to check to see if our models are underfitting or overfitting the training set.
